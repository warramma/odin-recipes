    <p>
        Kuih Bahula is a traditional Malaysian cake that is a favorite for any and all
        festive seasons, from Hari Raya to Chinese New Year. The bitesize bahulu are sweet
        and eggy and go well with coffee (although I've always preferred them on their own).
    </p>
    <p>
        Kuih Bahulu are commonly found in a flower shape because they are made from
        a special Kuih Bahulu mold. It's hard to find this mold outside of Malaysia
        so don't worry about hunting one down. A standard cupcake mold should work 
        just fine.
