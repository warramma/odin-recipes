    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups black glutinous rice</li>
        <li>3/4 cups coconut sugar or palm sugar</li>
        <li>3 1/3 cups water</li>
        <li>3 knotted pandan leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Rinse the black glutinous rice briefly with a water and drain off water 
        </li>
        <li>
            Put the rice in a blender or a food processor and pulse it a few times, about 5-6 times (depending on your food processor or blender) 
        </li>
        <li>
            Do this until at least most of the rice grains are broken. Remember we want them to be in smaller pieces and not into a powder. When you cook, the starch will release faster making it creamier and shorten the cooking time
        </li>
        <li>
            Put the rice in the inner pot of Instant Pot. Add sugar, pandan leaves, and water. Give it a stir. Close the lid. Turn the steam release valve to seal. Press "pressure cooker" and make sure it's on "high pressure" and set the timer to 30 minutes and then wait 10 minutes to release pressure
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        You're all done! To serve, use a ladle to put some bubur pulut hitam into a bowl and enjoy. 
        It can be served warm, room temperature, or cold.
